# Infrastructure-as-Code-AWS-Terraform-for-Node.js-Apps
My First Terraform Project

In this project, I automated the building of cloud infrastructure using Terraform. I deployed a scalable and secure Node.js application on AWS. The setup includes an EC2 instance for the application, an RDS MySQL database for persistent storage, and an S3 bucket for file storage.  I implemented security best practices, such as security groups and VPC isolation, to ensure secure communication between services.  Using an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach made the deployment streamlined, reproducible, and manageable.
